# Increment

Increment is a landing page for professionals in the tech field to use as a sort of "homebase." Increment allows users a personalized experience to store their settings in order to get personalized weather and news updates while giving them a journal they can write to in order to keep track of their thoughts for the day and revisit those journals in the future all with a pleasing image to see in the background.

## Getting Started

Start by logging into the system using your email and creating a password. You will also be prompted to enter your name in order to receive a personalized greeting each time you open the page. In the settings tab, in the lower left hand side of the screen, you can change your name at any time and also set your preference of city.

Once everything is setup, you will find the top trending stories in your upper right hand corner of the page. In the center of the page, you will find your current city's weather and the journal entry field. You can later access these journals in the lower right hand corner of the screen to see what you typed on a specific date. Lastly, you will find a fun feature in the top right hand corner of the screen to randomly generate a gif when you need to procrastinate on whatever you're working on or need a laugh.
